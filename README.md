# Decryption_Program 0
Problem 2 in Assignment 2

# Background Information
This activity serves as a practice of how to properly code Python Strings. Also, this repository explore us how to use different coding application.

# About The Program
Decryption is the process of taking text that has been created or encrypted or various data and turning it into text that we or a machine can read and understand. This word could refer to both a manual or keyed way of decrypting data.

To make it more difficult for someone to steal information, data may be encrypted. Some businesses additionally encrypt data in order to protect corporate information and confidential data. It could be necessary to decrypt the data if it needs to be viewed. In the absence of a decryption passcode or key, specialized software may be required to crack the decryption and make the data legible.
